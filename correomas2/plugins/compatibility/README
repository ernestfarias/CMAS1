Compatibility plugin for SquirrelMail
=====================================
Ver 1.2, 01/04/03

Original author: Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
Original idea: Bruce Richardson <itsbruce@uklinux.net>



Description
===========

This plugin allows any other plugin access to the functions
needed to make it backward (& forward) compatible with most
versions of SM in wide use.  This eliminates the need for
duplication of certain functions throughout many plugins.



Usage (Plugin Authors' Guide)
=============================

Currently, some of the functions that may or may not be available 
to you when coding a plugin targeted at as wide a SquirrelMail 
user base as possible include:

   check_sm_version();
   check_php_version();
   sqsession_register();
   sqsession_unregister();
   sqsession_is_registered();
   sqsession_is_active();
   sqgetGlobalVar();  (previously known as sqextractGlobalVar();)

This plugin provides backups for those functions, so you may
always assume that they are available.  In order to make use
of them, you must change you function calls as such:

   compatibility_check_sm_version();
   compatibility_check_php_version();
   compatibility_sqsession_register();
   compatibility_sqsession_unregister();
   compatibility_sqsession_is_registered();
   compatibility_sqsession_is_active();
   compatibility_sqextractGlobalVar();)

You must also make sure to include this plugin's functions.php
file as below:

   <?php

      // include compatibility plugin
      //
      if (defined('SM_PATH'))
         include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/compatibility/functions.php');
      else if (file_exists('../plugins/compatibility/functions.php'))
         include_once('../plugins/compatibility/functions.php');
      else if (file_exists('./plugins/compatibility/functions.php'))
         include_once('./plugins/compatibility/functions.php');


      function pluginname_compose_bottom_do()
      {


         // your code here


         // example of how to get a variable POSTed to this
         // last page request or retrieve a variable from
         // the current session
         // 
         global $myvar;
         compatibility_sqextractGlobalVar('myvar');


         // example of how to include another file
         //
         if (compatibility_check_sm_version(1, 3))
            include_once (SM_PATH . 'plugins/pluginname/config.php');
         else
            include_once ('../plugins/pluginname/config.php');


         // example of how to register a variable
         // in the current session 
         //
         $myothervar = 'some_value';
         compatibility_sqsession_register($myothervar, 'myothervar');


      }

   ?>


Although not directly related to this plugin, note that the 
advised format of a plugin's setup.php should be:

   <?php
          function squirrelmail_plugin_init_pluginname()
          {
             global $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks;

             $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['compose_bottom']['pluginname']
                = 'pluginname_compose_bottom';
          }

          function pluginname_compose_bottom()
          {
             if (defined('SM_PATH'))
                include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/pluginname/functions.php');
             else
                include_once('../plugins/pluginname/functions.php');
          
             pluginname_compose_bottom_do();
          }
   ?>

The goal is to keep setup.php as brief as possible.  This also
allows you to break up your code into logical chunks.  



Change Log
==========

  1.2 - Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynersd.com>
   * Fix for theme problem with plugins under SM 1.4

  1.1 - Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynersd.com>
   * Some applications of this plugin were experiencing
     unusual include order, so added includes of the
     global.php and strings.php files to be safe.
   * Even though older versions of SquirrelMail have
     some of the functions that this plugin duplicates,
     because they have session issues, the compatibility
     version of those functions now takes precedence over
     older SquirrelMail core code.

  1.0 - Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynersd.com>
   * Initial release
