Installing the Emoticons Plugin
===================================

This Plugin has only been tested with the following version
of Squirrelmail:

    - Squirrelmail Version: 1.4.0


This plugin has the following requirements. Please make sure you
have the following plugins installed before continuing:

    - Enhanced Textarea v5.2
    - Browser Info      v2.1


1) Unzip the file into the plugins directory.

2) You do *NOT* need to enable this plugin using conf.pl, since
   it does not use the standard plugin architecture. The Emoticons
   Plugin involves adding a single line to /src/compose.php. However, 
   if you use the Plugin Updates plugin, you do need to enable this 
   plugin in order to see it on the Plugin Updates page:

3) Backup your current squirrelmail/src/compose.php (the one already
   modified by the Enhanced Textarea plugin).

4) Look for the following line in the /src/compose.php file:



        if ($location_of_buttons == 'between') {
        showComposeButtonRow();
    }


   ******** ADD THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE CODE ABOVE ****


// **************** EMOTICONS ********************
include '../plugins/emoticons/insert.php';
// **************** EMOTICONS ********************


5) 

   ---------- optional ----------

   Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
   8 and add the compatibility plugin.  Save and exit.

      $ cd ../../config
      $ ./conf.pl

   ---------- optional ----------
