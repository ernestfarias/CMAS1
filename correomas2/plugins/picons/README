Picons for SquirrelMail

version 1.0

How to install:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Unpack this archive into the plugins directory of your squirrelmail
distribution.

2. Get hold of the picon databases. You certainly need the UNKNOWN database;
after that, install DOMAINS, MISC and USERS with that priority of importance.
If you have the disk space, install them all.

Under Debian, doing
   apt-get install picon-unknown picon-domains picon-misc picon-users
as root will do this for you. Otherwise, ftp them from
   ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/faces/picons/db/
and install them into the directory /usr/lib/picon (note: not picon_s_.)

3. Optionally, create a directory /usr/local/lib/picon, where you can store
your own picons. (You could also store the picons in plugins/picon, if you
don't think any programs are going to need picons other than this one.)

4. We're going to need a hook that doesn't exist in standard SquirrelMail.
The patch "picons.patch" will add it for you. (It's good at least for version
1.0.6). Go into your SquirrelMail root and type

   patch -p1 <plugins/picons/picons.patch

If you've installed it already, patch will tell you so, and ask whether you
want to install it again. Say no.

5. From your SquirrelMail root, run ./configure, choose plugins (option 8)
and move "picons" into the installed list.

That's it. Have a play. If it doesn't work, mail me and I'll try to give you
a hand.

What's coming in the next version:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Would anyone be interested in tools to mess around with picon databases?
I could add provision for users to upload their own picons, and to add
your picons to the global picons database in Indiana. Let me know whether
you'd use it.
