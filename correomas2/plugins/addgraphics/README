Ver 2.1, Mar 06 2003

This plugin allows the administrator to add a custom graphic to the top 
of the left-hand pane of the main Mailbox view.  The graphic will be 
displayed immediately above the Folders list.  

The graphic may be different for each domain you are hosting.  See
config.php for more information and configuration instructions.

The plugin supports resizing the width of the left-hand pane by the user.

The graphic should be small (200x100, for instance) and it should probably
be a Gif89a with transparent background to support different themes. 

Make sure you modify the config.php file and specify the location of the
graphic and the alternate tag (this is what is displayed if the picture
doesn't load or when you hover the mouse over the image).  I would 
recommend you put your graphic in the "images" directory.  If you do this, 
just change the filename from "sm_logo.jpg" to your filename (the ../ stuff 
will remain the same).
