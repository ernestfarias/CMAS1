Installing the addgraphics Plugin
=================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the addgraphics plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf addgraphics.1.00-1.0.3.tar.gz

2) Go into the addgraphics directory

  $ cd addgraphics

3) Copy the config.php.typical file that most suits your situation 
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as you deem 
   necessary. 

  $ cp config.php.typical.virtual.domain config.php
  $ vi config.php

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and add the addgraphics plugin.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config
  $ ./conf.pl

5) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.



Upgrading Addgraphics
=====================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the addgraphics plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf addgraphics.1.00-1.0.3.tar.gz

2) Change into the addgraphics directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.typical.virtual.domain

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 3 under the
   installation procedure above).
