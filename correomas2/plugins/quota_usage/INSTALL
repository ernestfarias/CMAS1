Installing Quota Usage
======================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.3 version of the quota_usage plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf quota_usage-1.3-1.2.7.tar.gz

2) Change into the quota_usage directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
   you deem necessary.

  $ cd quota_usage
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

   PLEASE NOTE that if you are using the MOTD warning 
   functionality in this plugin and you have any other plugins 
   that modify the MOTD, you should usually make sure that this 
   one is listed AFTER the other MOTD-related plugins.



Upgrading Quota Usage
=====================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.3 version of the quota_usage plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf quota_usage-1.3-1.2.7.tar.gz


2) Change into the quota_usage directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
