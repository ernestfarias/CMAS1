Quota Usage plugin for SquirrelMail
===================================
Ver 1.3, 07/11/04


Original author: Bill Shupp <hostmaster@shupp.org>

Description
===========

This plugin retrieves the currect quota usage from the IMAP 
server using the IMAP4 QUOTA extension.  It displays size-
based quotas and/or message-count quotas, as given by the IMAP
server.

The quota is displayed above the folder listing, and optionally
as a warning in the Message Of The Day if the quota is above
a configurable "yellow alert" or "critial" level.



Requirements
============

- IMAP server with QUOTA Extension support
- Quota set for user.  (if it's not set, nothing is displayed).
    NOTE:  Courier-IMAP may not report the quota if usage is 0%.  
           Try sending a message to the user if this is the case.
- Should work with versions of SquirrelMail as far back as 1.2.7 
  at least as well as version 1.5.1.  Please report problems and
  incompatibilities with these and other SquirrelMail versions.

I've tested this with Courier-IMAP 1.4.0 and above .  Courier-IMAP only deals 
with maildirquotas, as far as I know.  So it might not work with file system 
quotas.  I use it successfully with Vpopmail 5.1.4 and above, a virtual domain 
package for Qmail.

As of version 0.2, it should work with Cyrus IMAP as well.



Installation
============

Please read the INSTALL file.



Configuration
=============

There are just a few optional configuration items:  

   $fontsize                          --  Change this if you want to increase or decrease 
                                          the size of the text and bar graph shown
   $use_fancy                         --  Set this to 1 to use PHP's built-in image 
                                          generation functionality to create quota 
                                          displays images on the fly (which aren't 
                                          currently any fancier than normal HTML-based 
                                          quota display).  To use this, you must have
                                          PHP compiled with GD support.  See:
                                          http://php.net/manual/ref.image.php
                                          Also, NOTE that although the plugin attempts
                                          to prevent the browser from caching these images,
                                          they are unintentionally cached sometimes, and
                                          as such, using this option is not recommended.
   $warn_percent                      --  Change this to match the warning level of your 
                                          system.  It turns the bar graph to a red color
                                          when a user gets to the specified level
   $yellow_alert_percent              --  Set this to a percentage lower than $warn_percent
                                          if you want the graph to turn yellow at the 
                                          specified level.  Set to zero or an empty string
                                          to disable.                              
   $show_quota_intro_text             --  Turns the introductory text on or off
   $show_quota_count_intro_text       --  Turns the introductory text for message count
                                          quotas on or off
   $show_yellow_alert_MOTD_warning    --  Turns the yellow alert login warning on 
                                          or off
   $show_critical_alert_MOTD_warning  --  Turns the critical alert login warning 
                                          on or off
   $intro_text                        --  This is an override for the text that shows up 
                                          above the quota report; change as desired or 
                                          leave it blank to use the default value.  Only
                                          works if $show_quota_intro_text is turned on.
   $intro_text_count                  --  This is an override for the text that shows up 
                                          above the message count quota report (which only
                                          is displayed if such a quota exists); change as 
                                          desired or leave it blank to use the default 
                                          value.  Only works if $show_quota_count_intro_text 
                                          is turned on.
   $yellow_alert_quota_MOTD           --  This is an override for the warning message that
                                          is shown upon login if the user's quota usage is 
                                          over the $yellow_alert_percent.  Change as desired
                                          or leave it blank to use the default value.  Only 
                                          works if $show_yellow_alert_MOTD_warning is turned on.
   $critical_alert_quota_MOTD         --  This is an override for the warning message that
                                          is shown upon login if the user's quota usage is 
                                          over $warn_percent.  Change as desired or leave 
                                          it blank to use the default value.  Only works if 
                                          $show_critical_alert_MOTD_warning is turned on.
   $use_1000KB_MB                     --  Allows you to override how Megabytes are
                                          calculated: by default a Megabyte is 1024 
                                          Kilobytes, but turn this setting to 1 if
                                          you want to base Megabytes off of 1000 
                                          Kilobyte calculations
   $quota_usage_debug                 --  Helps diagnose problems by dumping QUOTA 
                                          response from IMAP server to the screen

These are all found in the config.php file.
