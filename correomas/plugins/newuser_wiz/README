This plugin prompts new users to enter their full name and email address.

I'm tired of telling people the same speach, which usually goes something like
"Once you get logged in, click 'options' and 'Personal Information', and set
your full name and email address.  No, you don't need to worry about anything
else on that page.  OK, now change your password."

This plugin is the solution.  I hope it works for you.
