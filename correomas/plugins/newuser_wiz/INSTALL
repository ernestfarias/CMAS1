Installing the New User Wizard plugin
=================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is an example using version 1.1 of the newuser-wiz plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -xzvf newuser_wiz-<version>.tar.gz

2) Then go to your SquirrelMail config directory and run conf.pl.  
   Choose option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd /path/to/squirrelmail/config/
  $ ./conf.pl

3) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.
