* Internals
***
Forced Preferences plugin uses standard SquirrelMail init function and 
hook calls to control options available to end user. Instead of adding 
own options, it reconstructs $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks, $optpage_data
and $optpage_blocks data.

If settings are enforced with $fp_forced_settings setting, plugin tries
to hide settings from end user. Plugin can control display of individual 
SquirrelMail options only when those options use SquirrelMail option 
widgets available in SquirrelMail 1.2.0 and newer.

If plugins don't use widgets, forced_prefs plugin can control display 
of options only by removing all plugin options. If user knows internals 
of SquirrelMail script layout, he or she is still able to connect to 
plugin option pages or tweak standard SquirrelMail forms and try changing 
enforced settings.

If plugins use own option widget blocks, forced_prefs plugin must be 
updated to use hooks provided by those plugins. See advanced_settings 
plugin for example.
