*****************************************
* Forced Preferences plugin Release Notes
*  version 1.2
*****************************************
This plugin version adds new configuration options ($fp_removed_optpage_urls 
and $fp_debug) that can be used to hide standard option blocks from end user.
and display debug information about processed data. This plugin version also 
allows to control advanced_settings plugin widgets. Configuration files
from previous versions should work with this version, but features provided 
by new configuration options won't be used.

Known issues:
* Option groups that contain only hidden options are not removed.
Title line is still visible and empty line before next group is
added.
* Interface still can be abused by end user, that knows internals
of SquirrelMail and can control form input data.
* Option pages still can be accessed by end user.

If you want total control, customize your SquirrelMail install and remove 
unwanted files and options. forced_prefs plugin provides only hacks that allow
hiding features from unexperienced end user.
