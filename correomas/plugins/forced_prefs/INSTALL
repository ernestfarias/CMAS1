Installing Plugins
==================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin.  Example below uses "plug_demo" as the name of the 
plugin:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /usr/archives/plug_demo.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin.  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

About forced_prefs configuration
================================

forced_prefs plugin configuration is stored in config/forced_prefs_config.php
or plugins/forced_prefs/config.php. If both files are missing, no setting
is enforced. If both files are present, plugin will use values from
config/forced_prefs_config.php

See plugins/forced_prefs/config-sample.php for sample configuration file.

Plugin is only able to control plugins that are enabled before forced_prefs 
plugin. Some features require hooks that are present only in SquirrelMail
v.1.2.0 or later versions. Debugging information can be displayed only 
in SquirrelMail v.1.4.1 or newer.
