*****************************************
* Forced Preferences plugin Release Notes
*  version 1.1
*****************************************
This plugin version adds new configuration option ($fp_disabled_hooks)
and tries to hide enforced options from end user. Configuration file
from previous version should work with this version.

Known issues:
* Option groups that contain only hidden options are not removed.
Title line is still visible and empty line before next group is
added.
* Interface still can be abused by end user, that knows internals
of squirrelmail and can control form input data.
